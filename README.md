**P2: Monte Carlo Tree Search for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**  
- Team member:

- **Requirement**  
  - - [x] Implement mcts_vanilla.py that uses MCTS with a full, random rollout. mcts_vanilla must beat rollout_bot most of the time.  
      ![This graph shows that mcts_vanilla beats rollout_bot most of the time.](mcts_vanilla_vs_random_bot.png) 
  - - [ ] Using your existing implementation from mcts_vanilla.py as base code, implement mcts_modified.py with the addition of your own heuristic rollout strategy as an improvement over vanilla MCTS. Optional: You may also adjust other aspects of the tree search, by implementing the variations discussed in class (roulette selection, partial expansion, etc).  
  - Perform the two experiments described below.  
    -  - [ ] Experiment 1 – Tree Size  
       -**100 nodes vs  100 nodes**  
       
    -  - [ ] Experiment 2 – Heuristic Improvement  
  - Extra Credit (Optional):
       - - [ ] Experiment 3 – Time as a Constraint
